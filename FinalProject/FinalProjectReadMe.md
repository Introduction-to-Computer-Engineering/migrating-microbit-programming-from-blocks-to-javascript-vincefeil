# Final Project

## Function

Monitor the temperature of a heat chamber and two sensors attached to critical components of a test unit.

## Operation

1.	On power up the Micro-Bit sets the desired temperature to 22deg C.
2.	Set the desired temperature of the heat chamber by pressing A to increase the temperature or pressing B to decrease the temperature.
3.	Pressing A and B will display the reading on the other two sensors.
