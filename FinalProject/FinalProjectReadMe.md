# Final Project

## Function

Control the temperature of a heat chamber and monitor the temperature of two sensors attached to critical components of a test unit.

## Operation

1.	On power up the Micro-Bit sets the desired temperature to 22deg C.
2.	Set the desired temperature of the heat chamber by pressing A to increase the temperature or pressing B to decrease the temperature.
3.  If the temperature in the heat chamber goes below the desired temperature the Micro-Bit thurns on the heating elements.
4.  If the temperature in the heat chamber goes above the desired temperature the Micro-Bit turns off the heat.
3.	Pressing A and B will display the reading on the other two sensors.
